# 🌱 FreshGrade

FreshGrade is an **AI-powered Quality Assurance (QA) and verified marketplace platform** for agricultural produce.  
It performs **quality verification first** and then enables **direct selling of verified produce** on the same platform.

Only produce that passes FreshGrade’s quality checks can be listed and sold.

## ❗ Problem

Agricultural supply chains face:

This creates **low trust between sellers and buyers**.

FreshGrade combines **Quality Assurance and Marketplace** into a single workflow.

1. Produce batches are analyzed using **AI-based quality checks**
2. Human QA reviewers verify and grade the produce
